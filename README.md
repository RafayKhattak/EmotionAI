## Model Training
If you're interested in training your own emotion detection model, follow these steps:
- Download the images dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset
- Implement and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using a framework like Keras or TensorFlow.
- Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune as necessary.
- Save the trained model weights.
- Update the model.h5 file in the project with your own trained model.
